# Lottery Contract

This project was created in order to showcase the connection between web3 and solidity outside Remix which is common for writing smart contracts.


### `to enter the lottery`

In order to enter the lottery, one needs to contribute some ether at least 0.01. 
Once there are more than person(s), the manager (the one who created this contract) is the only one with the capability to help pickWinner.
After the winner has been picked then the lottery resets itself.


### Web responsiveness

So far the contract is set for wide screens only, mobile and tablet sizes are still underway.
